### Installation

### FAQ
* __Does this add-on cause time to flow in the VAB or SPH?__

No, time stands still in the editor as usual.
* __Why doesn't the VAB/SPH start in night-mode when it's night outside?__

I prefer to build craft when the lights are on.  For now, turning the VAB/SPH lights on and off is tied to the day/night cycle.
